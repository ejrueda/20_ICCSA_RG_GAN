## Description
new approach based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify in-silico candidates for reference genes.<br /> The proposed method is divided into two main steps. First, the GAN is used to increase a small number of reference genes found in the public RNA-seq dataset of Escherichia coli. Second, a one-class SVM based on novelty detection is evaluated using some real reference genes and synthetic ones generated by the GAN architecture in the first step.<br />
The results show that increasing the dataset using the proposed GAN architecture improves the classifier score by 19%, making the proposed method have a recall score of 85% on the test data.
## Add some approaches for classification:
1) change one class svm parameters to achieve better results.<br />
2) Linear classifiers ( perseptron, Least square, Gradient descent, Widrow_Hoff,etc), Parzen, Gaussian mixture model.<br />
3) Dimension reduction methods and classification of data with new dimensions.<br />
4) Supervised and unsupervised mode.<br />
